Hello. Welcome to what will soon be a rather large Capstone project, but is currently a work-in-progress. Though the official launch date is in late July of 2020, please check back periodically to see how it develops beyond its MVP.

### Intro
Hello! Welcome to "Amongst The Stars": A first-person, VR-compatible space simulator.  
This project primarily aims to resolve two issues:  
1. Make space more relatable, while maintaining a scientifically accurate model  
2. Create a capstone project representative of my competetencies and passions

There are a multitude of issues involved in each of these, that are in some ways resolutions to each other.  
For example: given the scale of space, it's generally "fairly boring" and difficult to understand spatial  
relationships between objects. It is difficult to understand Space as "A space" rather than as an  
arbitrary set of unrelated locations. In short, as a "node" space instead of a living/breathing "place".
Resolving this issue is, I feel, both creatively and technically difficult, and doing so effectively communicates  
both competency both in solving algorithmically and mathematically complex problems, while maintaining an 
understanding of human UI interfaces and experiences. In short, being both accurate AND well-designed is an  
enormous challenge, and one I look forward to resolving in clever, subtle, insightful, and effective ways.  

Please see below for the proposal submitted for this project.

### Proposal

Name of Student: Christopher Huber

Name of Project: Amongst the Stars

Project's Purpose or Goal: Make space more approachable/interactable to the everyday user

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

    3D Model of Planets + Sun
    Movement Controls
    Raycaster-triggered context menus/Data displays

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

    Astronavigation (Ephemeris) Tables (JPL API most likely)
    React-Native for VR mode
    Planet Texture Map (planetpixelemporium.com)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

    Expand navigable space to extrasolar
    Near-Earth-Object API call populating NEOs
    Collapsable Solar System (Making Planets children of Sun)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

    Nasa API calls
    Possibly Databases - undecided on best method for storing large volumes of Star data.
    ThreeJS (under-the-hood stuff React uses to make extra features work).
