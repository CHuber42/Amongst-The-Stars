ASSUMING THAT:
Sun sits at 0, 0, 0;
From a top-down perspective, Earth orbits CCW;
And that the vernal equinox occurs at -X, 0, 0 (Mar 21)

THEN:
6 hours/90% RA is -Z, (Forward)
12 hours/180% RA is -X, (Left)
18 hours/270% RA is +Z, (Back)
and 0/24 hours 0/360% RA is +X (Right)
90 Degrees Polar Angle is +Y
-90 degrees polar angle is -Y
+90 degrees declination is +Y
-90 degrees declination is -Y
